# Gradient BBCode Generator, made by a Clanker™

A tiny single-page tool that takes your text, paints it with a per-character gradient, and lets you copy the BBCode.
That’s it. Text in → colorful text out → copy. At least the site looks nice while doing almost nothing.

## Features (yes, it has features)
- Live preview while you type
- BBCode output per character (`[COLOR=...]x[/COLOR]` repeated until your eyes glaze over)
- One-click copy
- Multiple color stops:
  - add/remove
  - drag & drop reordering
  - move up/down buttons
  - reverse order
  - “Rainbow-fy” button for instant candy mode (up to 24, based on text length)
- Output format: `HEX` or `RGB`
- Toggles:
  - include spaces in the gradient
  - escape `[` and `]` so your text doesn’t eat itself as BBCode
- Output length meter + soft cap (defaults to 600 chars) and “how many more chars can I add” estimate

## How to use
1. Open [the website](https://penandalokasi.github.io/gradient/) in your browser
2. Type/paste text
3. Pick colors (add more if you want chaos)
4. Click **Copy BBCode**
5. Paste into your post and enjoy your completely necessary gradient text

## Notes
- Needs at least 2 valid colors
- If you hit the length limit, congratulations: nothing happens unless you’re posting on that forum, in that specific spot
- aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
